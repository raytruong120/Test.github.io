	<h1 class="speaker"> Meet Marissa Mayer </h1>
	<p style="text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center"> Marissa Mayer, born on May 30, 1975, in Wausau, Wisconsin, was appointed CEO of Yahoo in 2012. Prior to joining Yahoo, she spent 13 years at Google, where her work in product development largely contributed to the site’s unique look and feel. At the time of Mayer’s Yahoo appointment, she was one of only 20 female CEOs in charge of a Fortune 500 company. Her tenure at Google involved work on some of the company’s most recognizable and successful products, including Google Maps, Google Earth, Street View, Google News and Gmail. Known as a fashionista with an eye for design, Mayer is widely credited for the unique look and feel that has come to characterize the Google experience. For example, she was responsible for approving each “doodle” (the custom logos commemorating holidays and events) appearing on the Google home page.</p> <br>
	<p style="text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center"> Mayer spent more than a decade at Google accumulating accolades for her work ethic, eye for detail and vision. In a 2008 interview, however, she seemed to be looking ahead to her next act. “I helped build Google,” Mayer said, “but I don’t like to rest on [my] laurels. I think the most interesting thing is what happens next.”</p>
